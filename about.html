					Indo-Pak food is known as the cuisine of the South Asia. It has its own identity, with influences from Indian spicy curries to dumplings from Tibet. 
					Pakistani food is famous for its high nutritional level and tempting taste, with spices and flavorings such as ginger, garlic, coriander, pepper, cumin, cardamon, bay leaf, cinnamon, clove, chilies, cilantro, turmeric and Himalayan herbs.
					Nepali food is a wonderful combination of Chinese and Japanese cuisine, mixed with its own distinctive elements. The food has a full-flavored taste that defies the winter ice and snow, most notably in the national dish, Achaar, a spicy pickle served at every meal. 
					Nepali meals are made up of many small, tempting dishes, flavored with soy sauce, garlic, ginger, bean paste and toasted sesame seeds.
					Our Indian dishes include the popular saag paneer, mattar paneer, steamed basmati rice and garlic naan (leavened bread garnished with garlic and cilantro, baked in our clay oven).
					A highlight of our appetizer is the Tibetan-style dumpling called momo. Available with or without meat, these tasty, steamed dumplings are stuffed with vegetables, cumin, garlic, ginger and spices, and are served with homemade achar (Tomatoe pickle).
